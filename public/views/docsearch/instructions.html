<h1>Document Revision Search</h1>
<p class="lead">
    DocSearch searches all docx and xlsx files within a provided source path for its revision information.
</p>

<p>
    To use DocSearch, simply provide a target path and source path and click the "Run Search" button. The source path is where your docs currently are. DocSearch is non-destructive and you do not need to worry about documents in your source path being altered. All data will be output to your target path.
